# Helium User Story

## USER STORY

- As a web application developer, I want a reference web application that is secure by default while leveraging engineering best practices so that I can easily fork and code and deploy.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Securely build, deploy and run an Azure App Service (Web App for Containers) application
- Securely build, deploy and run an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) application
- Use Managed Identity to securely access resources
- Securely store, access, and maintain secrets in Key Vault
- Securely build and deploy the Docker container from Azure Container Registry (ACR) or Azure DevOps
- Connect to and query Cosmos DB
- Automatically send telemetry and logs to Azure Monitor
- Multi developer languages (C#, Node.js, and Java Spring Boot)

Also, here are a few points that need to be addressed:

1. Key Rotation – Research restrictions, existing solutions, etc.
2. MI support for Web App Containers
3. Research secure ACR access
4. Java SDK capability
